This is an assignment that gives me practice while writing simple Python code 
This project is currently Finished.

Each problem had me code solutions for the user. It is very important that we do not create any syntax errors and that we make the code as easy to read as possible.

I learned how to write code more efficiently for the program.

some of the features of the program are in the last program. You can put any day in the program and because of the loop, it will work even if your vacation is past 7 days.
